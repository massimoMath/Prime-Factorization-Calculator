**This calculator allows you to calculate the prime factor decomposition of a positive integer and detects if the number is prime.**

The calculator presents two types of interface:
- A graphical interface (default), build with HTML, CSS and JavaScript that shows results as the following, *n<sup>a</sup> x n<sup>a</sup> x n<sup>a</sup>* ...
- An more detailed interface available on the console (f12), build with JavaScript, that shows every calculation performed as the following,

  *a / b*
  
  *c / d*
  
  *e / f*
  ...
