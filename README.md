**This calculator allows you to calculate the prime factor decomposition of a positive integer and detects if the number is prime.**

The calculator presents two types of interface:
- A graphical interface (default), build with HTML, CSS and JavaScript that shows results as the following, *n<sup>a</sup> x n<sup>a</sup> x n<sup>a</sup>* ...
- A more detailed interface available on the console (f12), build only with JavaScript, that shows every calculation performed as the following,

  *Calculation (1):*
  
  *a / b*
  
  *Calculation (2):*
  
  *c / d*
  
  *Calculation (3):*
  
  *e / f*
  ...
  
  Furthermore, advanced performance features are displayed (click on the *Complementary Information* section)
