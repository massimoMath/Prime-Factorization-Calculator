**This calculator allows you to calculate the prime factor decomposition of a positive integer.**

The calculator presents two versions for the results: 
- a simple, clear version that shows results as the following, *n<sup>a</sup> x n<sup>a</sup> x n<sup>a</sup>* ...
- a more detailed version, which shows every calculation performed, as the following,

  *a / b*
  
  *c / d*
  
  *e / f*
  ...
  
  This version is accessible from the console (press *f12*).
